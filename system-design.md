# System Design: Company-OS CLI

## 1. Overview & Objective

**Company-OS** is a terminal-native, multi-agent orchestration tool that simulates a fully autonomous corporate structure using local AI. Users bootstrap an organization with departments and specialized AI Employees, then delegate high-level goals to the CEO — who autonomously plans, assigns, and tracks work across the entire org chart before reporting outcomes back to the Owner.

The system runs entirely locally, using:
- **Pi** as the agent execution engine
- **Ollama** as the local LLM provider

### Goals
- Zero cloud dependency — all inference happens on-device via Ollama
- Hierarchical organization: Owner → CEO → Department Heads → Employees
- Structured plan lifecycle: draft → owner review & approval → department breakdown → execution → reporting
- Simple, portable state stored as a flat JSON file
- Clean CLI UX with formatted output and real-time feedback
- Extendable architecture to support async/parallel agents in v2.0

---

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The system is organized into six primary layers:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                         CLI Interface Layer                          │
│              (main.py — Typer + Rich, user-facing)                   │
└──────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┘
                                │

└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 3. Organizational Structure

The company mirrors a real corporate hierarchy. The Owner (the CLI user) sits above the system and interacts only with the CEO. The CEO coordinates all departments. Each department has a designated Head who manages their team of Employees.

```
Owner  (You — the CLI user)
  │
  └──► CEO  (one per company, special agent role)
            │
            ├──► Department: Engineering
            │         ├── Head: Alice  (Engineering Lead)
            │         ├── Bob          (Backend Developer)
            │         └── Carol        (Frontend Developer)
            │
            ├──► Department: Marketing
            │         ├── Head: Dave   (Marketing Director)
            │         └── Eve          (Content Writer)
            │
            └──► Department: QA
                      ├── Head: Frank  (QA Lead)
                      └── Grace        (Test Engineer)
```

### Role Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Sets high-level goals, reviews and approves plans, receives final reports |
| **CEO** | Drafts plans, revises on feedback, breaks plans into dept tasks, compiles final report |
| **Department Head** | Receives dept task, breaks into employee sub-tasks, reviews outputs, reports to CEO |
| **Employee** | Executes assigned sub-task via Pi/Ollama, returns output to department head |

---

## 4. Core Components

### 4.1 CLI Interface Layer (`main.py`)

**Libraries:** `typer`, `rich`

**Responsibility:** Parses user commands, validates inputs, displays formatted output, and routes to the appropriate layer.

#### Company Setup Commands

| Command | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `init` | `company-os init <name>` | Initialize company and create `company.json` |
| `hire-ceo` | `company-os hire-ceo --name <n> --model <m>` | Appoint the company CEO |
| `create-dept` | `company-os create-dept --name <n>` | Create a new department |
| `hire` | `company-os hire --name <n> --role <r> --model <m> --dept <d>` | Hire an employee into a dept |
| `set-dept-head` | `company-os set-dept-head --dept <d> --employee <n>` | Designate a dept head |
| `roster` | `company-os roster` | Display full org chart (CEO → depts → employees) |
| `fire` | `company-os fire <name>` | Remove an employee |

#### Planning & Execution Commands

| Command | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `plan` | `company-os plan "<goal>"` | Assign a goal to the CEO; CEO drafts a plan |
| `review-plan` | `company-os review-plan <plan-id>` | Owner reads the CEO's plan |
| `approve-plan` | `company-os approve-plan <plan-id>` | Owner approves the plan for execution |
| `revise-plan` | `company-os revise-plan <plan-id> "<feedback>"` | Owner sends edit feedback; CEO revises |
| `execute-plan` | `company-os execute-plan <plan-id>` | Run the approved plan through the full org hierarchy |
| `plan-status` | `company-os plan-status <plan-id>` | Check per-department and per-employee task progress |
| `final-report` | `company-os final-report <plan-id>` | View CEO's synthesized completion report |

#### Legacy Direct-Assignment Commands (still supported)

| Command | Signature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `assign` | `company-os assign <name> <task>` | Assign a task directly to one employee |
| `collaborate` | `company-os collaborate <a> <b> <task>` | Chain two employees sequentially |

#### Key Behaviors
- **Input Validation:** Flags missing or malformed arguments before they reach downstream layers
- **Loading Spinners:** Uses `rich.progress` to show `"Maxwell (CEO) is thinking..."` during LLM inference
- **Formatted Output:** Uses `rich.markdown`, `rich.panel`, `rich.tree`, and `rich.table` for readable terminal output
- **Error Messages:** Clear, actionable error messages with next-step suggestions

---

### 4.2 State Management Layer (`state.py`)

**Storage:** `company.json` — a flat JSON file in the working directory (or configurable via `COMPANY_OS_STATE` env var)

**Responsibility:** All CRUD operations on the company structure. Acts as the single source of truth.

#### Core Functions

```python
# Company lifecycle
init_company(name: str) -> None
load_state() -> dict
save_state(state: dict) -> None

# CEO management
hire_ceo(name: str, model: str) -> None
get_ceo() -> dict

# Department management
create_department(name: str) -> None
list_departments() -> list[dict]
set_department_head(dept_name: str, employee_name: str) -> None

# Employee management
hire_employee(name: str, role: str, model: str, department: str) -> None
fire_employee(name: str) -> None
get_employee(name: str) -> dict
list_employees(department: str = None) -> list[dict]
increment_task_count(name: str) -> None

# Plan management
create_plan(goal: str, content: str) -> str          # returns plan_id (e.g. "plan-001")
get_plan(plan_id: str) -> dict
list_plans() -> list[dict]
update_plan_status(plan_id: str, status: str) -> None
update_plan_content(plan_id: str, content: str) -> None
add_plan_revision(plan_id: str, feedback: str, revised_content: str) -> None

# Department & employee task tracking (within a plan)
set_dept_task(plan_id: str, dept: str, task: str) -> None
set_employee_task(plan_id: str, dept: str, employee: str, task: str) -> None
update_dept_task_status(plan_id: str, dept: str, status: str) -> None
update_employee_task_status(plan_id: str, dept: str, employee: str, status: str) -> None
set_employee_task_output(plan_id: str, dept: str, employee: str, output: str) -> None
set_dept_report(plan_id: str, dept: str, report: str) -> None
set_ceo_report(plan_id: str, report: str) -> None
```

#### Validation Rules
- **No duplicate names:** Returns an error if an employee or CEO with the same name already exists
- **Department existence check:** `hire` and `set-dept-head` verify the target department exists
- **CEO uniqueness:** Only one CEO allowed per company
- **Department head eligibility:** Only an existing employee within the department can be set as head
- **Ollama model check (pre-hire):** Pings `http://localhost:11434/api/tags` before saving; fails gracefully if model not found
- **Plan status gating:** `execute-plan` rejects plans not in `approved` status

---

### 4.3 Plan Manager (`plan_manager.py`)

**Responsibility:** Manages the CEO planning loop and the owner approval lifecycle. Each plan passes through a defined set of statuses before it is ready for execution.

#### Core Functions

```python
draft_plan(goal: str) -> dict
    # Invokes CEO agent via Pi to produce a structured plan document
    # Saves plan to state with status "draft"
    # Returns plan dict

request_revision(plan_id: str, feedback: str) -> dict
    # Invokes CEO agent with original plan + owner feedback
    # Saves revision record and updates plan content
    # Sets status to "pending-approval"
    # Returns updated plan dict

approve_plan(plan_id: str) -> None
    # Sets plan status to "approved"
    # Validates plan exists and is in "draft" or "pending-approval"
```

#### Plan Status Lifecycle

```
company-os plan "<goal>"
        │
        ▼
  CEO agent drafts plan
        │
        ▼
  status: "draft"
        │
  Owner reviews via `review-plan`
        │
        ├──► `approve-plan`  ──────────────────► status: "approved"
        │                                               │
        │                                               ▼
        └──► `revise-plan "<feedback>"` ─► CEO revises ─► status: "pending-approval"
                    │                                         │
                    └── Owner reviews again ◄─────────────────┘
                          (loop until approved)
                                │
                                ▼
                          `execute-plan` becomes available
```

#### Plan Document Format (produced by CEO agent)

```markdown
# Plan: <goal>

## Executive Summary
<1–2 sentence high-level overview>

## Objectives
- Objective 1
- Objective 2

## Department Breakdown
### Engineering
- Responsible for: <specific deliverables>

### Marketing
- Responsible for: <specific deliverables>

## Timeline
- Week 1: ...
- Week 2: ...

## Success Metrics
- Metric 1
- Metric 2
```

---

### 4.4 Hierarchy Engine (`hierarchy.py`)

**Responsibility:** Drives the full top-down execution pipeline once a plan is approved. Uses AI agents at each level to intelligently break down and delegate work, then synthesizes results bottom-up back to the Owner.

#### Core Functions

```python
breakdown_to_departments(plan_id: str) -> dict[str, str]
    # CEO agent reads approved plan
    # Outputs a per-department task assignment
    # Saves dept tasks to state; returns {dept_name: task_description}

breakdown_to_employees(plan_id: str, dept: str) -> dict[str, str]
    # Department head agent reads the dept task + employee roster
    # Outputs per-employee sub-task assignments
    # Saves employee tasks to state; returns {employee_name: task_description}

execute_employee_tasks(plan_id: str, dept: str) -> None
    # Iterates over assigned employees in the dept
    # Calls agent_runner.execute_task() for each employee
    # Saves outputs to state

compile_dept_report(plan_id: str, dept: str) -> str
    # Department head agent reads all employee outputs
    # Synthesizes a concise department-level completion report
    # Saves dept report to state; returns report string

compile_ceo_report(plan_id: str) -> str
    # CEO agent reads all department reports
    # Synthesizes final company-wide update report
    # Saves CEO report to state; returns report string
```

#### Full Execution Pipeline

```
company-os execute-plan <plan-id>
        │
        ▼
[Step 1] CEO: breakdown_to_departments()
  ├── CEO agent reads the approved plan content
  ├── Generates a specific task description per department
  └── Saves dept tasks → state (status: "pending")
        │
        ▼
[Step 2] For each department (sequential in v1.0):
  │
  ├── Dept Head: breakdown_to_employees()
  │     ├── Dept head agent reads their dept task + team roster
  │     ├── Generates a specific sub-task per employee
  │     └── Saves employee tasks → state (status: "pending")
  │
  └── For each employee (sequential):
        ├── Pi invocation: agent_runner.execute_task(employee, sub-task)
        ├── Output saved → state (status: "completed")
        └── Employee task marked complete
        │
        ▼
[Step 3] Dept Head: compile_dept_report()
  ├── Dept head agent reads all employee outputs
  ├── Synthesizes department summary
  └── Dept report saved → state
        │
        ▼
[Step 4] CEO: compile_ceo_report()
  ├── CEO agent reads all dept reports
  ├── Synthesizes final company-wide update
  └── CEO report saved → state
        │
        ▼
Owner reads final report via: company-os final-report <plan-id>
```

#### Prompt Templates (used by Hierarchy Engine)

**CEO → Department breakdown prompt:**
```
You are the CEO of {company_name}.

The following plan has been approved by the Owner:
---
{plan_content}
---

The company has these departments and their members:
{dept_roster}

Break this plan into specific, actionable task assignments — one per department.
For each department, write a clear task description that the department head can act on.
Output format: one section per department, prefixed with "DEPT: <name>".
```

**Department Head → Employee breakdown prompt:**
```
You are {head_name}, the {head_role} of the {dept_name} department at {company_name}.

Your department has been assigned the following task:
---
{dept_task}
---

Your team members are:
{employee_roster}

Break this task into specific sub-tasks — one per team member.
Output format: one section per employee, prefixed with "EMPLOYEE: <name>".
```

**Department Head → Compilation prompt:**
```
You are {head_name}, the {head_role} of the {dept_name} department.

Your team has completed their tasks. Here are their outputs:
{employee_outputs}

Write a concise department summary report covering:
1. What was accomplished
2. Key outputs or deliverables
3. Any issues or blockers encountered
```

**CEO → Final report prompt:**
```
You are the CEO of {company_name}.

All departments have completed their work. Here are their reports:
{dept_reports}

Write a final update report for the Owner covering:
1. Overall execution summary
2. Highlights from each department
3. Any outstanding risks or follow-up actions
```

---

### 4.5 Execution Engine (`agent_runner.py`)

**Mechanism:** Python `subprocess` module

**Responsibility:** Assembles the Pi invocation command from employee or CEO configuration, spawns the subprocess, and captures output.

#### Core Functions

```python
execute_task(employee_name: str, task_prompt: str) -> str
execute_ceo_task(prompt: str) -> str   # Uses CEO config instead of employee config
```

#### Execution Flow

```
1. Load agent config from state.py (employee or CEO)
2. Construct Pi command:
   pi --model <model> --system "<role_prompt>" "<task_prompt>"
3. Spawn subprocess (subprocess.run)
4. Stream/capture stdout
5. Increment tasks_completed in state
6. Return output string to caller
```

#### Error Handling
- **Pi not found:** Raise a clear error if the `pi` binary is not in PATH
- **OOM / crash:** Catch non-zero exit codes and surface stderr cleanly
- **Timeout:** Configurable via `COMPANY_OS_TIMEOUT` env var (default: 120s)

---

### 4.6 Inter-Agent Communication Layer

**Location:** Extended functionality in `agent_runner.py`, triggered by the `collaborate` command

**Responsibility:** Chains two agents sequentially. The output of Agent A becomes part of the input context for Agent B.

#### Core Function

```python
run_collaboration(agent1_name: str, agent2_name: str, task: str) -> tuple[str, str]
```

#### Data Flow

```

                 │
    ┌────────────▼─────────────┐
    │  Phase 1: Alice's Task   │

      },
      "ceo_report": "Q3 v2.0 launch plan executed successfully. Engineering delivered on time; Marketing launch campaign is ready. No blockers outstanding."
    }
  }
}
```

### Schema Notes
- `plan_id` is auto-generated as `plan-NNN` (zero-padded incrementing integer)
- Plan `status` values: `draft` → `pending-approval` → `approved` → `executing` → `completed`
- `revisions` is an append-only array; the latest entry reflects the current content
- Employee keys and department keys are lowercase strings (enforced by state layer)
- `is_department_head` is set automatically by `set-dept-head` command

# ── PLANNING LOOP ────────────────────────────────────────────────

company-os plan "Launch our new product by end of Q3"
  └─> Maxwell (CEO) drafts a structured plan via Pi
  └─> Saves plan-001 with status: "draft"
  └─> Displays plan in Rich markdown panel

company-os review-plan plan-001
  └─> Displays current plan content with status banner

company-os revise-plan plan-001 "Add more detail on the engineering timeline"
  └─> Maxwell (CEO) regenerates plan incorporating the feedback
  └─> Saves revision record; status → "pending-approval"
  └─> Displays revised plan

company-os approve-plan plan-001
  └─> Sets status → "approved"
  └─> Confirms: "Plan plan-001 approved. Run: company-os execute-plan plan-001"


# ── EXECUTION PIPELINE ───────────────────────────────────────────

company-os execute-plan plan-001
  └─> [Step 1] Maxwell (CEO) breaks plan into dept tasks
        └─> Engineering task saved
        └─> Marketing task saved
  └─> [Step 2] Alice (Eng Head) breaks dept task into employee tasks
        └─> alice task saved, bob task saved
  └─> [Step 3] Alice executes her task via Pi → output saved
  └─> [Step 4] Bob executes his task via Pi → output saved
  └─> [Step 5] Alice (Eng Head) compiles dept report from team outputs
  └─> [Step 6] Dave (Marketing Head) breaks dept task → executes → compiles report
  └─> [Step 7] Maxwell (CEO) reads all dept reports → writes final report

company-os plan-status plan-001
  └─> Renders per-dept and per-employee task status table

company-os final-report plan-001
  └─> Displays CEO's synthesized report to owner in Rich panel

## 8. Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `typer` | `>=0.12` | CLI command framework |
| `rich` | `>=13.0` | Terminal formatting, tables, trees, panels |
| `requests` | `>=2.31` | Ollama model validation API call |
| `python` | `>=3.11` | Language runtime |

**External Tools (must be installed on host):**
- `ollama` — local LLM runner
- `pi` — agent execution engine (in PATH)

---

## 9. Environment & Constraints

| Concern | Approach |
|---|---|
| Portability | Pure Python + flat JSON; works on macOS, Linux, cloud VM |
| Concurrency (v1.0) | Synchronous — departments and employees execute sequentially |
| Concurrency (v2.0) | `asyncio` + `asyncio.subprocess` for parallel department execution |
| State location | `./company.json` by default; configurable via `COMPANY_OS_STATE` env var |
| Task timeout | 120s default; configurable via `COMPANY_OS_TIMEOUT` env var |
| Security | System prompts sanitized before subprocess injection; `subprocess` list form prevents shell injection |
| Plan gating | `execute-plan` validates plan is in `approved` status before proceeding |

---

## 10. Future Considerations (v2.0+)

- **Async parallel departments:** Multiple department heads executing simultaneously via `asyncio`
- **Plan templates:** Reusable plan skeletons for common workflows (product launch, hiring sprint, etc.)
- **Persistent agent memory:** Optional context carry-over between tasks for the same agent
- **Task history log:** Append-only audit trail of every task run per employee
- **Trigger-based planning:** CEO automatically drafts plans in response to defined company events
- **Web dashboard:** Read-only browser view of org chart, plan status, and task outputs from `company.json`
- **Inter-department collaboration:** Department heads can request input from peer departments mid-execution
- **Plugin agents:** Custom agent types with extended tools (browser, file-system, code interpreter)
